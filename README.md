# Squirrel Programming Language

Squirrel is a simple, expression-based language with prototypal objects designed for an article series on writing language interpreters.

## Squirrel interpreter versions

The series will build a different feature of Squirrel into the interpreter with each article. Here are the features matched with the article code:

- Article 1: no code (overview of how interpreters and languages work)
- [Article 2](https://github.com/jasonsbarr/squirrel/tree/master/article_02): The Number type
