# Squirrel Programming Language

Squirrel is a simple, expression-based language with prototypal objects designed for an article series on writing language interpreters.

## Squirrel interpreter versions

The series will build different features of Squirrel into the interpreter with each article. Here are the features matched with the code for the different stages in which the interpreter was built:

- Part 1: The Number type
- Part 2: Binary arithmetic operations with precedence
- Part 3: Unary operations
- Part 4: Scopes and call expressions
- Part 5: Declaring and assigning variables
